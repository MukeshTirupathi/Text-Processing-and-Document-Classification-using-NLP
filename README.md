# Text-Processing-and-Document-Classification-using-NLP

In this session, we will teach you how to approach processing a text-based dataset, with the goal of training a classifier, based on classical machine learning techniques. We've chosen stance detection as an example of a document classification task.

We will perform some preprocessing on data, see how to transform textual data into feature vectors, how to train several algorithms, as well as how to evaluate the trained models. We will make use of the sklearn machine learning library in Python.

These are the topics we will cover:

Data Exploration
Text processing
Feature Extraction
Classification Models
Evaluation
Regularization
